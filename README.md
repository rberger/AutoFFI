Truss
=====

> A library for querying interopable program structure information.

Truss is a library which allows you to query a program's structure within your
own software, without relying on external compilers or parsers. Truss does the
heavy lifting of selecting the right compiler for the job, and returns things
such as a list of symbols and type information of a set of sources to your
program.
