Transit Clang Driver
====================

This is a driver for [Transit](http://github.com/samvv/Transit) which makes it
possible to convert C/C++/ObjectiveC source code to a Transit AST. A Transit
AST can in turn be used for a variety of applications. For more information,
visit the [Transit homepage](http://github.com/samvv/Tranit).

`transitc` is the name of the binary which is able to compile to a Tansit AST.
